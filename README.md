# phpmine
A PHP file that will delete all files in a directory and then delete itself.

How to use:

1 – Create a PHP file from “Mine” Source Code.

2 – Upload it to any directory in the target website.

3 – when you want to use it  just go to:

http://www.targetsite.com/path/mine_directory/p_mine.php

• You can upload many mines in different directories.

PHP Mine isn’t detectable so it’s like a ghost. ( you can change the $mine variable to any other word and remove GoSecurity comment ).

Enjoy.
